# BasicLoginApplication

Application to test user input validation, persistent data, database usage, and data encryption. This application isn't particularly useful for anything. It could be added onto a real application but my front end is not great. Also, no one really does desktop apps like this anymore, everything is web based.

Bugs

- The signin page should not have validation for the username and password. This should be reserved for the signup page and will be rectified in future commits.
- The white background is too high.
